**Q** - If I have plugin updates pending in addition to an agent update, do I need to update the agent version first?

**Q** - If I cannot use OnBoard to migrate archive data into alternatives like PST files but am part way through a migration, what are my options?  
**A** - If you haveÂ a requirement to migrate some of your archive data out to PST files or other alternative output, you would need to complete these steps using Migrator in the usual way.

**Q** - Your "Move to Cloud" Step is stuck at a certain percentage for too long e.g. usually a day or more.  
**A** - Check the OnBoard client logs, PowerShell tab for exceptions like **Check Service health** in reporting.
Useful powershell cmdlets: **get-moverequest** to check the status of the move request. If you want a detailed status report,
run **get-moverequeststatistics**
. In both cases always add a pipe < | FL >.

e.g.
```
Get-MoveRequest -Identity  usera@company.com | FL
Get-moverequeststatistics  -Identity  usera@company.com  | FL
```
