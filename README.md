# Documentation
We use DocFX for our help and documentation side of things.

## Prerequisite

To get your documentation platform configured we use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), the package manager for Windows.

To install all prerequisites, open a command prompt as administrator and enter the following:

```
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
choco install docfx atom git
```

Close the command prompt and open a new one as administrator again, this is needed to reload some environment variables. We will now install some additional packages that will assist in the formatting of your documentation.

```
apm install tool-bar markdown-writer tool-bar-markdown-writer git-clone
```

## [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)

To build the project, call the DocFX binary and point it to the repository ```docfx.json``` file and use the parameter ```--serve``` to spawn a web-service that listens on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

```
c:\docfx\docfx.exe c:\docs\docfx.json --serve
```

## [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TransVault/documentation)
You will need a GitHub account if you wish to contribute to our documentation library. If you do not yet have an account, you can sign up for a free one [here](https://github.com/join).

Once your account has been created you will need to advise Wayne of your loginID, so that you can be assigned the relevant permissions to the TransVault repository.

When permissions have been granted you will receive an email advising you have been invited  to collaborate on the TransVault/documentation repository.

You can clone our repo by opening the `Command Palette` "Ctrl+Shift+P" and type `git-clone` and press enter.

## Markdown Preview
Pressing "Shift+Control+M" whilst in an existing document will bring up the markdown preview pane, so you can see how your document will look once it's published.

## Connecting Atom to GitHub

```
git config --global user.email "your.github@email.com"

### Reviewing your Changes

If you select one of the `Unstaged Changes` in the Git pane, it will bring up a new window like the following:

Lines in Red are rows deleted, those in green are additions to the file.
